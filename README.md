# First-site

My first site is self-designed with:
 - BEM methodology,
 - 'strict mode' in the javascript file,
 - responsive design,
 - burger menu, 
 - three sections with smooth sending links around the site,
 - checking the device (smartphone or PC),
 - blocked by dragging and dropping pictures.
